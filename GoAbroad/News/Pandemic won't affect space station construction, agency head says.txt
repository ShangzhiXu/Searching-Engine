The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic won't affect China's goal of completing the Tiangong space station by the end of this year, the chief designer of the space station said.
"Missions related to the construction of the space station have received support from all sectors and local governments despite the COVID-19 epidemic. All missions are generally under control, so its completion won't be delayed," Hao Chun, director-general of the China Manned Space Agency, said on Sunday.
China's spending on building the space station is reasonable as it has been kept in line with the country's social development, Hao said at a news conference organized by the State Council Information Office.
"In general, China's manned space missions are relatively low cost and developing fast. Also, they have made many achievements and are sustainable," he said.
Upon completion of the Tiangong space station around the end of the year, it will consist of three major components - a core module linked with two large space labs, two Shenzhou spacecraft and one cargo ship, weighing around 100 tons. A total of six astronauts will stay inside the station - the largest space-based infrastructure China has ever built ¡ª before the Shenzhou XIV crew returns to Earth, according to the agency.

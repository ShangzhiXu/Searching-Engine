China's Shenzhou XIII spaceship has completed all planned tasks and will return to Earth soon, according to the China Manned Space Agency on Thursday.
On Oct 16, 2021, the Shenzhou XIII mission sent the three taikonauts to the Tiangong space station for a six-month stay -- the longest-ever duration in the country's manned space program.

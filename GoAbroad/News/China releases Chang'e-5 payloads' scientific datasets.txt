BEIJING - China has released a batch of datasets from the payloads installed on Chang'e-5 probe, according to the China National Space Administration on Saturday.
The payloads include a landing camera, a panoramic camera, a lunar mineralogical spectrometer and a lunar regolith penetrating radar, said the CNSA.

Nominations for the World Laureates Association (WLA) Prize is now open until June 1, and the awards ceremony will take place in November at the World Laureates Forum in the Lingang Special Area in Shanghai.
Launched at the 4th World Laureates Forum in 2021, the WLA Prize consists of the WLA Prize in Computer Science or Mathematics and the WLA Prize in Life Science or Medicine. Each comes with a 10 million yuan ($1.57 million) award.
Each of the annual prizes, managed by the WLA Development Foundation and sponsored by Sequoia China, will be awarded to at most four winners each time.
"The prize encourages scientific researchers to become more committed to the wellbeing of humans. It is believed that the prize, established in China through multi-lateral efforts, will become one of the world's most influential awards," said Roger Kornberg, chairman of the WLA and 2006 Nobel laureate in Chemistry.
"Global technological development has brought revolutionary and far-reaching impact since the start of this century, and the pace of development is only accelerating. We are committed to supporting cutting-edge technology and fundamental research and encouraging those who push forward the frontiers of science," said Neil Shen, founder and managing partner of Sequoia China.

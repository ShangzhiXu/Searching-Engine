BEIJING -- China's cargo spacecraft Tianzhou 3 separated from the country's space station core module Tianhe and redocked with the module on Wednesday.
Tianzhou 3 detached from the rear docking port of Tianhe at 5:02 am Beijing Time, moved to the module's front port and completed a computer-orchestrated rendezvous and docking at 9:06 am, according to the China Manned Space Agency.
It also said the combination of Tianhe and Tianzhou 3 is in good condition, waiting to dock with the Tianzhou 4 cargo craft, the Shenzhou XIV manned spaceship and the lab module Wentian.
China plans to complete the in-orbit construction of its space station by the end of 2022.
A total of six missions are planned for this year, including the launch of the Tianzhou 4 cargo spacecraft in May, the Shenzhou XIV manned spacecraft in June, the lab module Wentian in July, and the lab module Mengtian in October.
The three modules will form a T shape to complete the in-orbit construction of China's space station.
